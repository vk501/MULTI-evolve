# Multi-Evolve Streamlit App (Forked Deployment)

This repository contains a web-based deployment of the **MULTI-evolve** protein evolution framework, originally described in:

**Hon et al., Science (2020)**  
DOI: https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aea1820

## About the Project
The MULTI-evolve methodology provides multi-objective evolutionary optimization for protein sequences.
This repository forks the original codebase and adds a **Streamlit interface** to make the tool accessible via a browser.

## Features
- Upload protein sequences (FASTA)
- Run multi-objective evolutionary simulations
- View and download results
- Interactive UI with tabs and custom colors

## Usage
1. Visit the live app: [Streamlit App](https://multi-evolve-lbndchadlvfjeivne9sseu.streamlit.app)
2. Upload your protein sequence(s)
3. Configure simulation parameters
4. Run the evolution and explore results

> **Credit:** Algorithms and methodology are from the original publication (Hon et al., Science, DOI: 10.1126/science.aea1820). This project focuses on deployment via Streamlit for personal use.


# Overview

<p align="center">

</p>

Official repository for MULTI-evolve (model-guided, universal, targeted installation of multi-mutants), an end-to-end framework for efficiently engineering hyperactive multi-mutants. 

**The MULTI-evolve Python package has the following uses:**

1. Implement the workflow for the MULTI-evolve framework including: training neural networks, proposing multi-mutants, generating MULTI-assembly mutagenic oligos for gene synthesis of proposed multi-mutants, implementing the language model zero-shot ensemble approach to nominate single mutants to experimentally test.

3. Streamlined comparison of various data splitting methods, sequence featurizations, and machine learning models.

## Installation

### Linux

We used PyTorch 2.6.0 with CUDA 12.4 for our experiments. To run the scripts in this repository, we recommend using a conda environment.  Clone the repository, navigate to the root directory, and run the following commands to install the environment and package:
```bash
cd MULTI-evolve
conda env create -f env.yml
conda activate multievolve
pip install -e .
```
Check what torch+cuda version was installed by running:
```bash
python -c "import torch; print(torch.__version__)"
```

Then, run the following command, replacing `<VERSION>` with your torch version (e.g., `2.6.0+cu124`):
```bash
pip install torch-cluster torch-scatter torch-sparse torch-spline-conv torch-geometric \
    --find-links https://data.pyg.org/whl/torch-<VERSION>.html \
    --no-build-isolation
```

For example, if your torch version is 2.6.0+cu124, you would run:
```bash
pip install torch-cluster torch-scatter torch-sparse torch-spline-conv torch-geometric \
    --find-links https://data.pyg.org/whl/torch-2.6.0+cu124.html \
    --no-build-isolation
```

### Mac ARM-based

We used PyTorch 2.2.2 for our experiments. To run the scripts in this repository, we recommend using a conda environment.  Clone the repository, navigate to the root directory, and run the following commands to install the environment and package:
```bash
cd MULTI-evolve
conda env create -f env_mac.yml
conda activate multievolve
pip install -e .
```
Then, run:
```bash
pip install torch-cluster torch-scatter torch-sparse torch-spline-conv torch-geometric \
    --find-links https://data.pyg.org/whl/torch-2.2.2+cpu.html \
    --no-build-isolation
```

## Usage

The workflow for the MULTI-evolve framework is as follows:
1. Train fully connected neural networks to predict the fitness of a given sequence.
2. Choose the best performing neural network and use it to predict combinatorial variants.
3. For the chosen multi-mutants, generate the MULTI-assembly mutagenic oligos for gene synthesis.

In certain iterations, the MULTI-evolve framework involves using a protein language model zero-shot ensemble approach to nominate single mutants to evaluate.

### Interactive Web App

MULTI-evolve can be run as a interactive web app using Streamlit.

In the root directory of the repository run:
```bash
conda activate multievolve
streamlit run app.py
```

## Training and comparing various machine learning models

The MULTI-evolve package can be used to compare different data splitting methods, sequence featurizations, and machine learning models. In addition, the package can be used to perform zero-shot predictions with protein language models (ESM, ESM-IF). Examples are provided in the ```notebooks/examples``` folder.
